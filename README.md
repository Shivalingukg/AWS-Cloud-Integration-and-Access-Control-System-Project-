# AWS-Cloud-Integration-and-Access-Control-System-Project-
The AWS Cloud Integration and Access Control System project integrates AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda) to securely host applications and manage resources. It implements strong access controls using IAM, MFA, and RBAC, ensuring only authorized access. The system also ensures compliance, security monitoring, and real-time auditing.
